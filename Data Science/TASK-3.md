# Data Science Task - 3

Difficulty Level - Hard

## Task Description

### Objective:
Solve a complex problem using a real-world dataset and advanced machine learning techniques.

### Dataset:
You can use any dataset of your choice or find a publicly available dataset. If you need a suggestion, you can use the [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) or any other dataset you prefer.

### Tasks to Complete(You can perform any three of the following questions):
1. Load and preprocess the dataset, which may include handling missing data, feature engineering, and data transformation.
2. Perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's intricacies.
3. Choose a target variable (e.g., house prices in the case of the suggested dataset) and define the problem (e.g., regression or classification).
4. Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets.
5. Build and train a sophisticated machine learning model using advanced techniques (e.g., ensemble models, neural networks).
6. Implement feature selection and engineering to improve model performance.
7. Perform hyperparameter tuning and model optimization.
8. Include visualizations and insights to explain the model's predictions.

NOTE: Write a comprehensive report or Jupyter Notebook documenting your analysis, model selection, and optimization process.
