# Data Science Task - 2

Difficulty Level - Medium

## Task Description

### Objective:
Build a machine learning model to predict a target variable using a real-world dataset.

### Dataset:
You can use any dataset of your choice or find a publicly available dataset. If you need a suggestion, you can use the [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) or any other dataset you prefer.

### Tasks to Complete(You can perform any three of the following questions):
1. Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
2. Choose a target variable to predict.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Build and train a machine learning model (e.g., decision tree, random forest, logistic regression) to predict the target variable.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
6. Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters.


NOTE: Write a brief report or Jupyter Notebook documenting your analysis and model building process.
